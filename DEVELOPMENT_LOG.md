# FitCheck Development Log

## 🧥 FitCheck — Complete App Identity & Architecture

### **App Overview & Philosophy**

FitCheck is a mobile-first social fashion app built with React Native (Expo) and Firebase, designed for small friend groups to post and rate daily outfits in a private, brutally honest, and competitive space.

**Core Concept**: Users create or join private fit groups where they post one outfit per day, rate others' fits anonymously, and compete on daily leaderboards. Think BeReal meets RateMyProfessor, but for fashion—and just among your crew.

**App Philosophy**:

- Style accountability within real friend groups
- Honest feedback, not social clout
- Building daily rituals around self-expression
- Raw, private, and personal—not polished like Instagram, not public like TikTok

### **Tech Stack**

- **Frontend**: React Native (Expo SDK 49)
- **Backend**: Firebase
- **Auth**: Firebase Authentication
- **Database**: Firestore
- **Image Upload**: Firebase Storage
- **Styling**: Custom StyleSheet with dark theme
- **State Management**: React Context + Hooks
- **Navigation**: React Navigation v6

│   └── {userId}.jpg
├── fit-images/
│   └── {fitId}.jpg
└── group-images/
    └── {groupId}.jpg
```

### **Security Rules**

**Firestore Rules**:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only read/write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    // Group members can read/write group data
    match /groups/{groupId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null &&
        request.auth.uid in resource.data.members;
    }

    // Fits visible to group members only
    match /fits/{fitId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null &&
        request.auth.uid in get(/databases/$(database)/documents/groups/$(resource.data.groupId)).data.members;
    }

    // Ratings by group members only
    match /ratings/{ratingId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null &&
        request.auth.uid in get(/databases/$(database)/documents/groups/$(resource.data.groupId)).data.members;
    }

    // Comments by group members only
    match /comments/{commentId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null &&
        request.auth.uid in get(/databases/$(database)/documents/groups/$(resource.data.groupId)).data.members;
    }

    // Daily winners user-specific
    match /dailyWinners/{docId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null &&
        request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
    }

    // Notifications user-specific
    match /notifications/{notificationId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null &&
        request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
    }
  }
}
```

**Storage Rules**:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    // Profile images: users can upload their own
    match /profile-images/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null &&
        request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    // Fit images: group members can upload
    match /fit-images/{fitId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }

    // Group images: group members can upload
    match /group-images/{groupId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### **Critical Data Operations**

#### **Posting a Fit**

```javascript
// 1. Upload image to Firebase Storage
const imageRef = ref(storage, `fit-images/${fitId}`);
await uploadBytes(imageRef, imageBlob);
const imageURL = await getDownloadURL(imageRef);

// 2. Create fit document
const fitData = {
  userId: user.uid,
  groupId: selectedGroup.id,
  imageURL,
  caption,
  tags,
  createdAt: serverTimestamp(),
  date: format(new Date(), "yyyy-MM-dd"),
  ratingCount: 0,
  averageRating: 0,
  totalRating: 0,
  isWinner: false,
};
await addDoc(collection(db, "fits"), fitData);

// 3. Update user's groups array (if needed)
await updateDoc(doc(db, "users", user.uid), {
  groups: arrayUnion(selectedGroup.id),
});
```

#### **Rating a Fit**

```javascript
// 1. Create rating document
const ratingData = {
  fitId,
  raterId: user.uid,
  groupId,
  rating: ratingValue,
  createdAt: serverTimestamp(),
  isAnonymous: true,
};
await addDoc(collection(db, "ratings"), ratingData);

// 2. Update fit's rating stats
const fitRef = doc(db, "fits", fitId);
await updateDoc(fitRef, {
  ratingCount: increment(1),
  totalRating: increment(ratingValue),
  averageRating: (currentTotal + ratingValue) / (currentCount + 1),
});
```

#### **Calculating Daily Winner**

```javascript
// 1. Get all fits from yesterday for user's groups
const yesterday = format(subDays(new Date(), 1), "yyyy-MM-dd");
const fitsQuery = query(
  collection(db, "fits"),
  where("date", "==", yesterday),
  where(
    "groupId",
    "in",
    userGroups.map((g) => g.id)
  )
);
const fitsSnapshot = await getDocs(fitsQuery);

// 2. Calculate winner based on thresholds
const threshold = getRatingThreshold(userGroups.length);
const eligibleFits = fitsSnapshot.docs
  .map((doc) => ({ id: doc.id, ...doc.data() }))
  .filter((fit) => fit.ratingCount >= threshold)
  .sort((a, b) => b.averageRating - a.averageRating);

// 3. Store winner for user
if (eligibleFits.length > 0) {
  const winner = eligibleFits[0];
  const docId = `${user.uid}_${yesterday}`;
  await setDoc(doc(db, "dailyWinners", docId), {
    userId: user.uid,
    winnerFitId: winner.id,
    winnerUserId: winner.userId,
    groupId: winner.groupId,
    date: yesterday,
    averageRating: winner.averageRating,
    totalRatings: winner.ratingCount,
    createdAt: serverTimestamp(),
    winnerData: {
      username: winner.username,
      profileImageURL: winner.profileImageURL,
      imageURL: winner.imageURL,
      caption: winner.caption,
      tags: winner.tags,
    },
  });
}
```

#### **Sending Notifications**

```javascript
// 1. Create notification document
const notificationData = {
  userId: recipientId,
  type: "comment",
  title: "New Comment",
  body: `${senderName} commented on your fit`,
  data: { fitId, groupId },
  isRead: false,
  createdAt: serverTimestamp(),
  senderId: user.uid,
};
await addDoc(collection(db, "notifications"), notificationData);

// 2. Send push notification (if user has token)
const userDoc = await getDoc(doc(db, "users", recipientId));
if (userDoc.data().pushToken) {
  // Send FCM notification
  await sendPushNotification(userDoc.data().pushToken, notificationData);
}
```

## ⚠️ **CRITICAL WARNINGS FOR DEVELOPERS**

### **Database Safety**

- **NEVER** delete entire collections without user confirmation
- **ALWAYS** use user-specific queries (where userId == currentUser.uid)
- **NEVER** modify user data without explicit user action
- **ALWAYS** validate data before writing to Firestore
- **NEVER** use `deleteDoc` on user documents without confirmation

### **Image Storage**

- **NEVER** delete user images without explicit user action
- **ALWAYS** use proper image compression before upload
- **NEVER** store images in base64 format
- **ALWAYS** clean up orphaned images when fits are deleted

### **User Data Privacy**

- **NEVER** expose user data to other users without proper permissions
- **ALWAYS** use group-based access control for fits and comments
- **NEVER** store sensitive data in client-side storage
- **ALWAYS** validate user permissions before data operations

### **Performance Considerations**

- **NEVER** fetch all documents without pagination
- **ALWAYS** use proper indexing for queries
- **NEVER** perform heavy operations on the main thread
- **ALWAYS** implement proper error handling and loading states

### **UX Improvement: Instant Filter Switching Without Page Refreshes (Latest)**

### **UX Improvement: Instant Filter Switching Without Page Refreshes (Latest)**

- **Issue:** Switching between group filters in HomeScreen caused full page refreshes with loading states, creating poor user experience

### **Critical Bug Fix: PostFitScreen Not Showing After Photo Selection (Latest)**

- **Issue:** After selecting a photo in CustomPhotoPicker and clicking "Next", PostFitScreen wasn't appearing and users were returned to home
- **Root Cause:** PostFitScreen was missing the entrance animation setup. The `fadeAnim` and `slideAnim` were initialized to 0 but never animated to 1, making the screen invisible and off-screen
- **Solution:** Added missing entrance animation useEffect that triggers when image is available
- **Implementation:**
  - Added useEffect that animates fadeAnim from 0 to 1 and slideAnim from 0 to 1
  - Animation duration: 200ms for smooth entrance
  - Triggers when image prop is available
- **Impact:** PostFitScreen now properly slides in from the right with fade animation
- **Testing:** Verify photo selection → PostFitScreen transition works correctly

### **Critical Bug Fix: (+) Button Navigation to Home Tab (Latest)**

- **Issue:** When users clicked the (+) button, the app wasn't navigating to the Home tab in the background before showing the CustomPhotoPicker overlay
- **Root Cause:** The (+) button was only calling `setShowPhotoPicker(true)` without navigating to the Home tab first
- **Solution:** Added delayed `navigation.navigate('Home')` to happen behind the CustomPhotoPicker overlay
- **Implementation:**
  - Modified CustomTabBar PostFit button onPress handler
  - Show CustomPhotoPicker overlay immediately for instant response
  - Added 1-second delay before `navigation.navigate('Home')` to happen in background
  - Users don't see the navigation transition
- **Impact:** Users now always return to Home tab when clicking (+) button, but the navigation is invisible behind the overlay
- **Testing:** Verify (+) button works from any tab and navigation happens seamlessly behind overlay

### **Navigation Flow Optimization: Simplified Photo Picker to PostFit (Latest)**

- **Issue:** PostFlowScreen was causing white screen and unnecessary complexity
- **Root Cause:** Added unnecessary intermediate screen (PostFlowScreen) that wasn't needed

  2. Restored photo picker overlay in MainTabs component
  3. Optimized animations to reduce lag (removed fade animations)

- **Root Cause:**
  1. Invalid `gestureDirection: 'horizontal-inverted'` configuration in MainNavigator.js (not supported by @react-navigation/native-stack)
  2. Invalid `navigation.replace()` calls to non-existent screens in navigation stack
  3. Early return with navigation call causing React Native screen parsing errors
- **Solution:**
  1. Fixed navigation configuration: Changed `gestureDirection: 'horizontal-inverted'` to `gestureDirection: 'horizontal'` with `gestureEnabled: true`
  2. Replaced invalid `navigation.replace()` calls with `navigation.goBack()`
  3. Fixed early return issue by showing loading spinner instead of calling navigation.replace and returning null
  4. Added missing ActivityIndicator import
- **Impact:** GroupDetailsScreen now loads without crashing the app
- **Testing:** Verify GroupDetailsScreen navigation works in both authenticated and non-authenticated states

### **CustomPhotoPicker to PostFitScreen Flow - Balanced Performance (Latest)**

- Current implementation only supports a single winner per user per day, not per group.
- PinnedWinnerCard and Hall of Flame do not update based on group filter.
- User wants: Each group has its own daily winner, "All" filter shows the top fit across all groups, and Hall of Flame is group-specific.

## Refactor Plan

### 1. **Database & Service Layer**

- **Change winner storage:**
  - Store daily winners per user, per group, per date.
  - Document key: `{userId}_{groupId}_{date}` (and `{userId}_all_{date}` for "all").
- **Update winner calculation:**
  - For each group the user is in, calculate the top fit for that group (meeting rating threshold).
  - For "all", calculate the top fit across all groups.
  - Allow a user to win in multiple groups on the same day.
- **Service API:**
  - Add functions to fetch winner for a specific group and date, and for "all".
  - Add function to fetch winner history for a group (for Hall of Flame).

### 2. **PinnedWinnerCard Component**

- Accept a `selectedGroup` prop (group ID or "all").
- Fetch and display the winner for the selected group and date.
- Update UI to handle group-specific context.

### 3. **HomeScreen**

- Pass the current group filter to PinnedWinnerCard.
- When the filter changes, PinnedWinnerCard updates accordingly.

### 4. **HallOfFlameScreen**

- Accept a `selectedGroup` prop.
- Show winner history for the selected group (or "all").
- Update navigation to pass group context.

### 5. **Navigation**

- When navigating to Hall of Flame, pass the current group filter.
- Ensure Hall of Flame always shows the correct group context.

### 6. **Testing & Validation**

- Test with multiple groups, users, and fits.
- Validate that winners are correct for each group and "all".
- Ensure UI updates correctly when switching filters.

---

_This refactor will ensure the app supports group-specific competition, accurate winner display, and a more engaging Hall of Flame experience._

## [COMPLETED] Group-Specific Winners, PinnedWinnerCard, and Hall of Flame Implementation

### **Critical Bug Fixes Applied:**

#### **1. Winner Calculation Date Logic (FIXED)**

- **Issue:** Calculating winners for today's date but displaying yesterday's winners
- **Fix:** Changed winner calculation to use yesterday's date
- **Impact:** PinnedWinnerCard now correctly displays yesterday's winners

#### **2. Midnight Reset System (ADDED)**

- **Feature:** Automatic winner calculation at midnight
- **Implementation:** Added useEffect with interval checking for midnight
- **Behavior:** Calculates yesterday's winners and refreshes feed at 12:00 AM

#### **3. Enhanced Error Handling (IMPROVED)**

- **Added:** Comprehensive logging for winner calculation process
- **Added:** Better error handling in PinnedWinnerCard
- **Added:** Manual winner calculation function for testing

#### **4. Fit Data Structure Compatibility (FIXED)**

- **Issue:** Winner calculation service expected `groupId` field but fits use `groupIds` array
- **Issue:** Service expected `averageRating` field but fits use `fairRating` field
- **Fix:** Updated DailyWinnerService to use `groupIds` array-contains queries and `fairRating` field
- **Impact:** Winner calculation now works with current fit data structure

#### **5. Tie-Breaking Logic Implementation (FIXED)**

- **Issue:** When users had tied average ratings, winner selection was arbitrary (first in array)
- **Fix:** Implemented comprehensive tie-breaking system:
  - **Primary:** Average rating (highest wins)
  - **Secondary:** Number of ratings (more ratings wins)
  - **Tertiary:** Posting time (earlier post wins)
- **Implementation:** Updated both `calculateAndSaveGroupWinner` and `calculateAndSaveAllWinner` functions
- **Impact:** Fair and predictable winner selection even with tied ratings

### **Current Implementation Status:**

- ✅ **Group-specific winners** - Working correctly
- ✅ **"All" filter winners** - Working correctly
- ✅ **PinnedWinnerCard updates** - Working correctly
- ✅ **Hall of Flame navigation** - Working correctly
- ✅ **Midnight reset system** - Implemented
- ✅ **Error handling** - Improved
- ✅ **Fit data structure compatibility** - Fixed (groupIds array, fairRating field)
- ✅ **Tie-breaking logic** - Implemented (rating → count → time)
- ✅ **PinnedWinnerCard stability** - Optimized (scrollable header, minimal re-renders)
- ✅ **Debugging cleanup** - Removed all console logs and test button for production

### **User Experience Flow:**

1. **Today:** Users post fits and rate them
2. **Midnight:** System automatically calculates yesterday's winners
3. **Tomorrow:** PinnedWinnerCard displays yesterday's winners
4. **Group Filter Changes:** Winner updates immediately for selected group

### **Testing Recommendations:**

- Test with multiple groups and users
- Verify winner calculation at different times
- Test group filter switching
- Verify Hall of Flame navigation with group context
