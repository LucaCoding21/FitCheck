# FitCheck Development Log

## üß• FitCheck ‚Äî Dev Log Overview

FitCheck is a mobile-first app built with React Native (Expo) and Firebase, designed for small friend groups to post and rate daily outfits in a private, brutally honest, and competitive space.

It's like BeReal meets RateMyProfessor, but for fashion‚Äîand just among your crew.

### üì± Core Concept

Users create or join private fit groups, where they can:

- **Post one fit (outfit) per day**
- **Upload a photo** from camera or gallery
- **Add a caption and tag** (e.g. "casual", "school")
- **Fits are visible to group members only**
- **Rate other fits in the group**
  - 5-star rating system
  - Option to leave a comment
  - All fits are rated anonymously by default
- **Compete on the Daily Leaderboard**
  - Ranks group members by average fit rating
  - Requires minimum 3 ratings to be eligible
  - Updates live and resets daily
- **Leave and receive comments**
  - Comments are public within the group
  - Anyone in the group can comment on others' fits
  - Comments show up in a notification center

### üß† App Philosophy

FitCheck is designed for:

- Style accountability within real friend groups
- Honest feedback, not social clout
- Building daily rituals around self-expression

The vibe is raw, private, and personal‚Äînot polished like Instagram, not public like TikTok.

#### **üìä Common Data Queries**

**Get User's Fits:**

```javascript
// Query fits where userId equals current user's UID
const fitsQuery = query(
  collection(db, "fits"),
  where("userId", "==", user.uid)
);
```

**Get Group's Fits:**

```javascript
// Query fits that belong to specific group
const fitsQuery = query(
  collection(db, "fits"),
  where("groupIds", "array-contains", groupId)
);
```

**Get Today's Fits:**

```javascript
// Query fits posted today for leaderboard
const today = new Date();
today.setUTCHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
const tomorrow = new Date(today);
tomorrow.setUTCDate(tomorrow.getUTCDate() + 1);

const fitsQuery = query(
  collection(db, "fits"),
  where("groupIds", "array-contains", groupId),
  where("createdAt", ">=", today),
  where("createdAt", "<", tomorrow)
);
```

**Get User Profile:**

```javascript
// Get user document by UID
const userDoc = await getDoc(doc(db, "users", user.uid));
const userData = userDoc.data();
```

#### **üîÑ Real-time Data Updates**

**Listen to Fits Changes:**

```javascript
// Real-time listener for fits in a group
const unsubscribe = onSnapshot(fitsQuery, (snapshot) => {
  const fits = snapshot.docs.map((doc) => ({
    id: doc.id,
    ...doc.data(),
  }));
  setFits(fits);
});
```

**Listen to User's Fits for Notifications:**

```javascript
// Real-time listener for user's own fits to get notifications
const userFitsQuery = query(
  collection(db, "fits"),
  where("userId", "==", user.uid)
);
```

#### **üíæ Data Update Patterns**

**Add Rating to Fit:**

```javascript
// Update fit document with new rating
await updateDoc(doc(db, "fits", fitId), {
  [`ratings.${user.uid}`]: {
    rating: ratingValue,
    timestamp: new Date(),
  },
  ratingCount: newRatingCount,
  fairRating: calculatedAverage,
  lastUpdated: new Date(),
});
```

**Add Comment to Fit:**

```javascript
// Add comment to fit's comments array
await updateDoc(doc(db, "fits", fitId), {
  comments: arrayUnion({
    userId: user.uid,
    userName: user.displayName,
    userProfileImageURL: user.photoURL,
    text: commentText,
    timestamp: new Date(),
  }),
});
```

**Update User Profile:**

```javascript
// Update user document
await updateDoc(doc(db, "users", user.uid), {
  username: newUsername,
  profileImageURL: newImageURL,
  updatedAt: new Date(),
});
```

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes**

1. **Image URLs**: Always use `imageURL` (capital "URL") not `imageUrl`
2. **Rating Access**: Use `fit.ratings[user.uid]` to get current user's rating
3. **Timestamp Handling**: Use `.toDate()` method for Firestore timestamps
4. **Array Fields**: `groupIds` (in fits) and `members` (in groups) are arrays, use `array-contains` queries
5. **User Groups**: User documents use `groups` field (not `groupIds`)
6. **Group Members**: Group documents use `members` field (not `memberIds`)
7. **Real-time Updates**: Use `onSnapshot` for live data updates
8. **Error Handling**: Always wrap Firebase operations in try-catch blocks
