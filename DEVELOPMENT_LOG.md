# FitCheck Development Log

## 🧥 FitCheck — Dev Log Overview

FitCheck is a mobile-first app built with React Native (Expo) and Firebase, designed for small friend groups to post and rate daily outfits in a private, brutally honest, and competitive space.

It's like BeReal meets RateMyProfessor, but for fashion—and just among your crew.

### 📱 Core Concept

Users create or join private fit groups, where they can:

- **Post one fit (outfit) per day**
- **Upload a photo** from camera or gallery
- **Add a caption and tag** (e.g. "casual", "school")
- **Fits are visible to group members only**
- **Rate other fits in the group**
  - 5-star rating system
  - Option to leave a comment
  - All fits are rated anonymously by default
- **Compete on the Daily Leaderboard**
  - Ranks group members by average fit rating
  - Requires minimum 3 ratings to be eligible
  - Updates live and resets daily
- **Leave and receive comments**
  - Comments are public within the group
  - Anyone in the group can comment on others' fits
  - Comments show up in a notification center

### 🧠 App Philosophy

FitCheck is designed for:

- Style accountability within real friend groups
- Honest feedback, not social clout
- Building daily rituals around self-expression

The vibe is raw, private, and personal—not polished like Instagram, not public like TikTok.

#### **📊 Common Data Queries**

**Get User's Fits:**

```javascript
// Query fits where userId equals current user's UID
const fitsQuery = query(
  collection(db, "fits"),
  where("userId", "==", user.uid)
);
```

**Get Group's Fits:**

```javascript
// Query fits that belong to specific group
const fitsQuery = query(
  collection(db, "fits"),
  where("groupIds", "array-contains", groupId)
);
```

**Get Today's Fits:**

```javascript
// Query fits posted today for leaderboard
const today = new Date();
today.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
const tomorrow = new Date(today);
tomorrow.setDate(tomorrow.getDate() + 1);

const fitsQuery = query(
  collection(db, "fits"),
  where("groupIds", "array-contains", groupId),
  where("createdAt", ">=", today),
  where("createdAt", "<", tomorrow)
);
```

**Get User Profile:**

```javascript
// Get user document by UID
const userDoc = await getDoc(doc(db, "users", user.uid));
const userData = userDoc.data();
```

**Get User's Notifications:**

```javascript
// Query notifications for current user
const notificationsQuery = query(
  collection(db, "notifications"),
  where("userId", "==", user.uid),
  orderBy("createdAt", "desc")
);
```

#### **🔄 Real-time Data Updates**

**Listen to Fits Changes:**

```javascript
// Real-time listener for fits in a group
const unsubscribe = onSnapshot(fitsQuery, (snapshot) => {
  const fits = snapshot.docs.map((doc) => ({
    id: doc.id,
    ...doc.data(),
  }));
  setFits(fits);
});
```

**Listen to User's Fits for Notifications:**

);
```

#### **💾 Data Update Patterns**

**Add Rating to Fit:**

```javascript
// Update fit document with new rating
await updateDoc(doc(db, "fits", fitId), {
  [`ratings.${user.uid}`]: {
    rating: ratingValue,
    timestamp: new Date(),
  },
  ratingCount: newRatingCount,
  fairRating: calculatedAverage,
  lastUpdated: new Date(),
});
```

**Add Comment to Fit:**

```javascript
// Add comment to fit's comments array
await updateDoc(doc(db, "fits", fitId), {

});
```

await updateDoc(doc(db, "users", user.uid), {
  username: newUsername,
  profileImageURL: newImageURL,
  updatedAt: new Date(),
});
```

**Update Notification Preferences:**

```javascript
// Update user's notification preferences
await updateDoc(doc(db, "users", user.uid), {
  notificationPreferences: {
    commentNotifications: true,
    ratingNotifications: false,
    newFitNotifications: true,
  },
  updatedAt: new Date(),
});
```

#### **⚠️ Important Notes**

1. **Image URLs**: Always use `imageURL` (capital "URL") not `imageUrl`
2. **Rating Access**: Use `fit.ratings[user.uid]` to get current user's rating
3. **Timestamp Handling**: Use `.toDate()` method for Firestore timestamps
4. **Array Fields**: `groupIds` (in fits) and `members` (in groups) are arrays, use `array-contains` queries
5. **User Groups**: User documents use `groups` field (not `groupIds`)
6. **Group Members**: Group documents use `members` field (not `memberIds`)
7. **Real-time Updates**: Use `onSnapshot` for live data updates
8. **Error Handling**: Always wrap Firebase operations in try-catch blocks
9. **Notification Preferences**: Check user preferences before sending notifications
10. **Push Tokens**: Store and manage Expo push tokens for push notifications

### 2024-12-19 - Firebase Auth Persistence Fix ✅

**Production Readiness Improvement:**

- ✅ **AsyncStorage Integration**: Installed `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` package
- ✅ **Persistent Auth State**: Updated Firebase config to use AsyncStorage instead of memory persistence
- ✅ **Warning Resolution**: Eliminated Firebase Auth warning about missing persistence configuration
- ✅ **User Experience**: Users will now stay logged in between app sessions

This fix ensures that authentication state persists properly across app sessions, providing a seamless user experience and eliminating the Firebase warning that appeared during development.

### 2024-12-19 - Dynamic Leaderboard Rating Thresholds for Viral Growth ✅

**Viral Growth Optimization:**

- ✅ **Dynamic Rating Thresholds**: Implemented adaptive rating requirements based on group size
- ✅ **Small Group Accessibility**: Groups with 1-3 members now only need 1 rating to join leaderboard
- ✅ **Progressive Scaling**: Medium groups (4-6) need 2 ratings, larger groups (7-10) need 3 ratings
- ✅ **Maximum Cap**: Very large groups (11+) capped at maximum 4 ratings requirement
- ✅ **Viral Engagement**: Dramatically reduces barrier to entry for small friend groups

**Rating Threshold Logic:**

- ✅ **1-3 Members**: 1 rating required (perfect for small friend groups)
- ✅ **4-6 Members**: 2 ratings required (balanced for medium groups)
- ✅ **7-10 Members**: 3 ratings required (maintains quality for larger groups)
- ✅ **11+ Members**: 4 ratings maximum (prevents gaming in very large groups)

### 2024-12-19 - Fair Cross-Group Leaderboard Ranking System ✅

**Critical Issue Resolution:**

- ✅ **Cross-Group Fairness**: Fixed unfair comparison between small and large groups in "All Groups" view
- ✅ **Adjusted Rating Algorithm**: Implemented sophisticated ranking that normalizes for group size differences
- ✅ **Anti-Gaming Protection**: Added penalties for very small groups to prevent rating manipulation
- ✅ **Participation Bonus**: Rewards groups with higher rating participation ratios
- ✅ **Balanced Competition**: Ensures fair comparison across groups of different sizes

**Adjusted Rating Formula:**

- ✅ **Base Rating**: The fit's actual average rating (0.0-5.0)
- ✅ **Rating Bonus**: (ratingCount / groupSize) \* 0.5 (max 0.5 bonus)
- ✅ **Small Group Penalty**: 0.3 points for groups with ≤3 members
- ✅ **Final Score**: baseRating + ratingBonus - smallGroupPenalty

This implementation addresses the core viral growth challenge by making leaderboards accessible to all group sizes while maintaining data quality. Small groups can now participate immediately, dramatically increasing the app's viral potential and user engagement.

### 2024-06-20 - Group Create/Join Modal Refactor & Onboarding UX Fix ✅

**Refactor & UX Improvement:**

- ✅ **Reusable GroupModal Component:** Extracted all create/join group modal logic from GroupScreen into a new `GroupModal` component in `src/components/`.
- ✅ **NoGroupsScreen Modal Integration:** The empty groups page (NoGroupsScreen) now opens the create/join modal directly when the user clicks "Create Group" or "Join Group"—no navigation to Groups tab occurs.
